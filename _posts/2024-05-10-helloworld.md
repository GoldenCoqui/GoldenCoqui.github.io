## What Does This Website Have?

Welcome to my portfolio website! This website is designed to showcase my talents and who I am as a person.

I will be posting projects I've done, whether from college, work, or just personal projects. I also want to use this website to give a peek into who I am as a person, including my volunteer work, personal hobbies, and interesting reading material I've found.

## What is the About Tab?

If you're an employer, feel free to check out my About tab, where you'll find a summary of my work history, accomplishments, college history, and more. You can also download my resume from that page. My contact information will be at the bottom of the page as well.

## What is the Categories Tab?

The Categories tab is where all my posts will be located. It's structured in a file system format. You'll be able to find projects I did by following specific paths.

## What is the Tags Tab?

The Tags tab allows you to find specific topics discussed on my website. 

For example, if you want to see things related to Python, you can go to the Tags tab and click the "Python" tag. The website will generate a list of posts that have the Python tag.

## What is the Archives Tab?

The Archives tab provides a timeline for the posts made on this website. If you want to see my work over the years, this is the best place to get an idea of what I've been up to.

**I hope this document helps you understand my website. Thank you for checking it out!**
