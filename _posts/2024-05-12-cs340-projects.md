# Algorithms and Data Structures Projects Overview

## [Checkout GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/GoldenCoqui/cs340-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures-Projects)

## Project Summary

Throughout my Algorithms and Data Structures course, I engaged in a series of projects aimed at deepening my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures. These projects allowed me to apply theoretical concepts in practical scenarios, honing my problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Primarily implemented in C++ and/or Java
- **Tools:** Various IDEs and libraries relevant to each project

## Project Details

### Project 1: Time Complexity Analysis of Heap Sort vs Insertion Sort

- Conducted an empirical analysis comparing the time complexity of Heap Sort and Insertion Sort algorithms.
- Implemented both sorting algorithms and benchmarked their performance on various input sizes.
- Analyzed the results to understand how the time complexity of each algorithm scales with input size.

### Project 2: Priority Queue Implementation

- Designed and implemented a priority queue data structure from scratch.
- Utilized various underlying data structures such as arrays or binary heaps to achieve efficient priority queue operations.
- Demonstrated the usage of the priority queue in solving relevant problems requiring prioritization.

### Project 3: Book Word Count

- Developed a program to count the occurrences of specific words in a given book.
- Utilized data structures such as hash tables or binary search trees for efficient word counting.
- Applied techniques to handle large datasets efficiently and accurately.

### Project 4: Prim's Algorithm vs Dijkstra's Algorithm

- Explored and compared the characteristics of Prim's and Dijkstra's algorithms for solving minimum spanning tree and shortest path problems, respectively.
- Implemented both algorithms and evaluated their performance and suitability for different scenarios.
- Analyzed the trade-offs between time complexity and space complexity for each algorithm.

### Project 5: Spell Checker with Hash Tables (GUI)

- Designed and implemented a spell checker application with a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Leveraged hash tables for efficient word storage and retrieval.
- Developed an intuitive user interface to interact with the spell checker, allowing users to input text and receive real-time feedback on spelling errors.

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I gained valuable experience in:
- Implementing and analyzing various algorithms and data structures.
- Evaluating algorithmic performance through empirical analysis.
- Designing efficient solutions to practical problems using appropriate data structures.
- Developing user-friendly applications with graphical interfaces.

## Key Takeaways

- **Problem-solving Skills:** These projects enhanced my ability to tackle complex problems by breaking them down into manageable components and applying appropriate algorithms and data structures.
- **Technical Proficiency:** I developed a strong foundation in algorithm design and analysis, as well as practical programming skills through hands-on implementation.
- **Collaboration and Communication:** Working on these projects often involved collaboration with peers, which improved my teamwork and communication skills.

## Conclusion

The projects completed during my Algorithms and Data Structures course have equipped me with a solid understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, as well as practical experience in applying them to real-world problems. I am confident that the skills and knowledge gained through these projects make me a valuable asset for roles requiring expertise in algorithm design, data structures, and software development.
